 # DesigningCompiler
This project aims at designing a compiler for a new programming language. It will be carried out in several phases. First and foremost, I designed a scanner which can identify tokens according to the prescribed grammar of the language. In the second phase, I developed a Parser which is dedicated to parse the scanned tokens according to the prescibed rules of this new programming language. In further phases, I will be desining an Abstarct Syntax Tree &amp; Type Checking. In the final phase, I hope to compile a code on this new progarmming language.The final codes are available on request.
